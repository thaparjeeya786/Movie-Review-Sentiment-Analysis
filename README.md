# 🎥 Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Movie Review Sentiment Analysis** project is an intelligent text classification system that determines whether a given movie review expresses a **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiment.  

By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques, the project analyzes user-generated reviews and provides insights into public opinion about movies.  
This system can be extended for real-time analytics, social media monitoring, or recommendation platforms, offering valuable insights into audience preferences and emotional tone.

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. **Data Collection** – The system uses a dataset of movie reviews (from IMDb, Kaggle, or other sources).  
2. **Text Preprocessing** – Reviews are cleaned by removing special characters, stopwords, and converting text to lowercase.  
3. **Feature Extraction** – Techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings are used to convert text into numerical form.  
4. **Model Training** – Machine learning or deep learning models are trained on labeled data (positive/negative).  
5. **Prediction** – When a new review is entered, the model predicts its sentiment label.  
6. **Visualization** – Graphs or charts display the distribution of positive and negative sentiments.
